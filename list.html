<h2>how to make a cake </h2>

<p>To make a classic vanilla cake, start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and preparing two 8-inch round cake pans by greasing and flouring them or lining them with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour, 2 ½ teaspoons of baking powder, and ½ teaspoon of salt, then set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream 1 cup of softened unsalted butter with 1 ¾ cups of granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add 4 eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, and stir in 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients in three parts, alternating with 1 cup of whole milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix gently after each addition until just combined—do not overmix. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost and decorate with your favorite frosting if desired.</p>
